# Compiler
This is the beginnings of a compiler, (made in c) that I made with help from Ianertson (Youtube). Unfortunately, since I do not use Linux, I was unable to conitnue past the Abstract syntax tree. There were also a few changes made in the assembly (compaared to his video) since I was attempting to convert it to windows masm assembly, but I was unable to do that.
